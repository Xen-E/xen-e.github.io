## Downloads

To make sure you're downloading the latest binaries please check the [releases](https://github.com/Xen-E/pcxx/releases) page.

### Windows
For x86-64 architecture (64bit): [PCxx_x86_64_setup.exe](https://github.com/Xen-E/pcxx/releases/download/1.0/PCxx_x86_64_setup.exe)

For i686 architecture (32bit): [PCxx_i686_setup.exe](https://github.com/Xen-E/pcxx/releases/download/1.0/PCxx_i686_setup.exe)

### Linux
For Linux in general download [PCxx_Linux_v1.0.zip](https://github.com/Xen-E/pcxx/releases/download/1.0/PCxx_Linux_v1.0.zip), extract it then find a file called "Run Me" and double click it OR right click and hit "Run" thats's it! You don't need to make it executable just run it. Please notice that this binary was built using Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS (Focal Fossa) which is based on Debian. So if you face any problems try to build the project yourself (Check below).

### macOS/Other
Right now i don't have a mac to test and make binaries, But the project should work fine if you have Qt/TagLib installed in your system. You can build it easily... Check the building section below.

## Building

PC++ built using the [Qt](https://www.qt.io) framework (**5.15.2**), that means you need to have a Qt toolchain installed in your system... Make sure to have the **Qt Designer** as well so you can open the project file.

### Linux
Also make sure you have [TagLib](https://taglib.org) library in your system, If you use Linux (Debian/Ubuntu...etc) open the terminal and type:
```console
sudo apt install libtag1-dev
```
Arch Linux:
```console
sudo pacman -S taglib
```
### Windows
In Windows you gonna need to download the source files and build it yourself, Nothing special just cmake stuff... Example:
```console
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ..
make
```
> Notice that `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` will produce a **static** version which is important.

After that modify the Qt Project file (**PCxx_QT.pro**) and change the old library path to the new one.
