When **Nothing** company announced their first phone ever (Phone(1)) last march everyone got excited, because the current state of the smartphone industry it's just boring and lack innovation. Xiaomi currently dominates it and i don't mind because they give their customers more bang for their buck or basically what they paid for, unlike other brands like Samsung for example which is declining and got knocked off from top 1 by Xiaomi last year. And they did it without the US market as well!<!--more-->

And since **Nothing** did very well with their wireless earbuds (Ear(1)) last year in july i was very curious how they're going to tackle the current smartphone industry, I watched the Youtube [event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cq7dnESV7Y) they did few months ago and they promised to bring something new and innovative to the table!

So far and according to the latest news which is also confirmed by them in their twitter profile...Things doesn't look very good, Nor pleasing. And honestly doesn't surprise me at all because this company uses some cringey "US AND THEM" marketing strategy.

Some of the things that is confirmed:
* A Qualcomm Snapdragon processor (Probably 7 Gen 1 ?)
* A recycled Aluminum mid-frame
* Transparent back
* Wireless charging
* No-Chin (?)

The company has already revealed its launch partners for the Phone(1):
* O2 in the UK
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* Flipkart in India

As for the price is rumored to be around â‚¬500 ($535), Which is the price of a mid-range phone. This can be great price if the phone would have some high-end features/processor. we'll see THIS WEEK.
